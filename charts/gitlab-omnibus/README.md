> This chart is beta. We are building a set of Cloud Native
charts at [helm.gitlab.io](https://gitlab.com/charts/helm.gitlab.io). The goal of that work
is to fully replace this chart.

# GitLab-Omnibus Helm Chart

This chart is the easiest way to get started with GitLab on Kubernetes. It includes everything needed to run GitLab, including: a Runner, Container Registry, automatic SSL, and an Ingress. For more information, please review [our documentation](http://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/kubernetes/gitlab_omnibus.html).
